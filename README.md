Proje 1
[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

1)  Write the stages of the above array according to the insertion sort type.
2)  Show the Big-O notiation.
3)  Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle,Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we're looking for is at the very beginning of the array.
4)  What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? Write it.
5)  [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] Write the four stages of the array according to the insertion sort type.

Step by step
Step 1: [22,27,16,2,18,6]
Step 2: [16,22,27,2,18,6]
Step 3: [2,16,22,27,18,6]
Step 4: [2,16,18,22,27,6]
Step 5: [2,6,16,18,22,27]

2. O(n^2)

3. 
The worst case: n!= n*(n+1)/2= (n^2+n)/2 => O(n^2) The number in the last of the array is smallest. 
Average case: The number in the middle of the array is 18.
The best case: The array is sorted by O(n)

4.The avarage case.
